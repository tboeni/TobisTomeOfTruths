## The Apothecary's Ledger

A small, leather-bound book with a clasp in the shape of an open eye. It contains Tanov’s encrypted notes on shard experimentation.

Effect:

While studying the ledger for at least 10 minutes, you can identify the basic magical properties of any shard-corrupted item or creature.

Once per long rest, you can recall a “formula” from the ledger to gain advantage on one saving throw vs disease, poison, or necrotic damage.

Drawback: The notes are laced with disturbing diagrams and fragmented prayers to unknown entities — prolonged study risks small SAN-style Wisdom saves to avoid nightmares.

## Necrotic Lens

A blackened monocle or small scope, made from shard-dust fused into glass. Sometimes a visage shifts over the dark glass but is gone in the blink of an eye.

Effect:

As a bonus action, you can focus through the lens and designate a creature within 150 ft.

Until the end of your turn, your next ranged weapon attack against that target deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage.

3 charges, regains 1d3 charges at dawn.

Drawback: Looking through the lens too long shows you reflections of things that aren’t there, requiring a DC 12 WIS save to avoid being rattled (flavor only, or minor disadvantage for 1 round).
