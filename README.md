## Altanarra Homebrew Rules

* Brutal Criticals
* Lingering Death Saves
* Hidden Death Save Rolls
* Potions as Action, Bonus Action or Interaction (Dimishing quality of results)
* Preferably no "Lucky" feat
* No need for ammunition or spell component tracking

## Altanarra Base Workings

* The Campaign has a time line of set events which will happen, unless the players do interact with the given key players before hand (in the right way of course)
(Meaning that if the players choose to do "side"-quests instead of the main storyline, it will progress regardless.
* The setting is one of low magic. Magic is not considered witch craft but the average citizen will not be able to cast a cantrip.
* Altanarrans are generally a kind-hearted folk, the ones strained by the stale mate war at the borders will probably not look to favourably to either the crown of non-Altanarrans
* Common folk will (depending on their circumstances) be somewhat distrustful of strangers. Escpecially ones wearing strange armor, wielding magic or being of non-human descent.
Most can be convinced otherwise however.
