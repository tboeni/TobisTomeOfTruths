# Organizations and People of Interest

## Cult of Szur
Fanatics trying to somehow bring back the endtimes and restore the former lich-ascendant back to unlive. Led by their high apostle they aim to gather the shards of Zurs Phylactery for a dark ritual. The High Inquisitors are aware of their plans but do not plan on intervening before they have gathered all or enough of these shards, as their creed to protected Altanarra from the undead scourge means to use every resource available, even if it means to use the dark magics still lingering in the shattered phylactery (They mean to consume the power of the souls still stored in the fragments to empower themselves further).
The Cult occupied small hideouts all over Altanarra. 

## Forsworn
The highest ranking paladings, the High Inquisitors, form the [Forsworn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRhwM4iE-r0Vi07Oylui3JN2-pXIFHK9C-EO8phDwrrfCvQJ9UPjTpjb8xmkW-EdRAitU7L7q1efBYo/pub).
They are the immortal guardians of the living in Altanarra, however it is unknown who these High Inquistors are and even their existence is a myth. In the rare cases that someone had seens a glimpse of an High Inquisitor they simply saw armorered holy warriors their faces hidden behind adorned helmets encircled by a sanguine halo

The rumors are somewhat true, as Sofos is a [Magus Dragon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSqiqtMLBS864bmnCuL5CZ4l0Z1QqohkHTgEYCGsmNQR7lf3Nr6ubovXepjor746vpeK6TW_OPdW7tf/pub)
