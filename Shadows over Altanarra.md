<details>
 <summary><h1>The Jaroomian Empire</h2></summary>
 
 The Jaroomian Empire lies far to the West, separated from the rest of Omnia by a natural mountain side, tall and fierce. Due to that fact, most contact with the center nations is limited to only the occasional traders by boat or caravan.
 The Empire is ruled by the Thunder King, a figure appearing in legends for many decades. Their beliefs are tribal and the land a lush and vibrant jungle.
 **Captiol:** Tokaar, City of Storms. Ruled by Jergal Oupha the "Thunder King"

 <details>
 <summary><h1>Hyllestad</h2></summary>
 
 A cold and harsh land, ruled by clans and its unforgiving environment. Clan Rykke holds the title of strongest for several decades and is thus by right entitled to the rule of Hyllestad. Quarrels among the clans are no rarity, duels for honor and glory neither. 
 **Captiol:** Drunvold, Clan Rykke holds dominion over Drunvold and thus has the final word and sway over all the other clans. Chieftain Yvar Trollbane leads Clan Rykke

 <summary><h1>Daz'alor</h2></summary>
 Bordering to the Southeast Altanarra lies the kingdom of non-humans, forest- and mountain-dwellers. The different races inhabiting the area follow the leadership of the “Speakers”. Delegated envoys, old and wise of each of the races inhabiting Daz’alor.
 **Captiol:** A'nalone, ruled by a council of chosen representatives of all the different people in Daz'alor

 <summary><h1>Ulwenwald</h2></summary>
 The neutral land centering Omnia. Home to Solaris, the flying city, and birthplace of many a powerful magic user. A neutral country, striding for progress and peace. Solaris sends advisors to the most powerful houses in each of the kingdoms to influence and guide them towards a better future. Each kingdom has 5 magic users at their disposal.
 **Captiol:** Solaris, the flying city, ruled by the head of [Seydir Academ](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#seydir-academy), [Sofos Alitheia](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/edit/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#sofos-alitheia)

  # Locations

  ## Hearth
  The bustling capitol of Altanarra. Much like the sigil of the country, the cities structure is reminicent of a great tree. Towering over the rest of Hearth is the "Crown" where the white tree, symbol of Altanarra, resides and the royal palace is situated. Some of the nobles are also allowed to reside in their mansions here. The Crown is separated by massive walls from the lower district the "Branches" where most of the trading and education is done. The main barracks are also found here as well as the tall church of Ilmather. The people living in the Branches are mostly wealthy trades people and other people of middle to higher social status. Again separated by thick walls in the lowest parts of Hearth one find the "Roots". Most of the poorer common folk is situated here. But most things can be found here as well, just of lesser quality most of the times. Thhe people are not wealthy but mostly content here. There is crime but not rampant.

  ## Heartlands
  ### Hearth
  ## Nordemar
  ### Riverheart
  ## Ostemar
  ### Borrsted
  ## Sodemar
  The most Southern province of Altanarra, bordering to [Ulvenwald]() in the South, the massive [Dragonridge Mountains]() in the East, the mysterious [Forlonn Forest]() to the North and Hearthlands to the West. The Province is neither poor nor wealthy as most of its trade is compromised of Stone harvested from quarries along the mountainside and wood. Most of the populace is involed in the production of one of these goods, farming or fishing (especially around Lake Morrighan). [Gerrad Driscoll]() is the magistrate ruling the province from his castle in **Duskhaven** advised by [Inyll]() a mage of Seydir Academy. Traders from outside are rare but not unusual as [Ulvenwald]() is closeby. The people are not afraid of newcomers but weary nontheless as the conflict on the Southeastern borders are present on the poeples mind.
  
  ### Duskhaven
  Captiol of Sodemar, the largest town of the province, bustling streets with merchants and tradespeople, many goods, equipment and baubles can be found here for a price. Most people are working class. The town is encolsed by thick city walls protected by the towns very own guards who are patrolling the streets, keeping law and order. A barracks of the royal army can be found here commandeered by [Knight Captain Thelian Lagon]() which is off limits to outsiders except by direct invitation or royal decree. Although the army has a foothold in the city they are only called upon in times of need if there are major attacks or other dangers that threaten the safety of the town or province. The church of Ilmather is found here as well lead by [Highpriestess Ludmilla Ocatan](). [The Collegium]() has a branch of their academy here where aspiring scholars and the offspirng of the upper echelon are trained and if they show potential sent to the academy in Hearth. [Magistrate Gerrad Driscoll] resides in Duskhaven in **Castle Dusk** from where he rules the province.

  </details>
  
  ### Grenzstad

  The most southern town of Sodemar. A rather poor place in perspective of the rest of Sodemar, made up by mostly trades people and farmers. A small shirne to Ilmather is located here, but no priest with divine powers resides in Grenzstad. There is a single inn where a bed for the night can be rented. The town is lead by Ealdorman [Frederic Thornberg](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#frederic-thornberg) who also issued the contract about the shadowy figures haunting the surroundings of Grenzstad at night.
  The **Sleepy Hedgehog Inn** is lead by [Miryam Bell](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#myriam-bell). There are some simple vendors found on a crude market place selling general goods, groceries and the occasional weapon.
  The priest of the shrine is [Patrick Harper](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#patrick-harper) 
  <details>
  <summary>Sleepy Hedgehog Inn</summary>

  The inn is nothing but a very ordinary inn. It is a two story building with the ground floor being the tavern area. Upon entering the inn, you greeted by a crackling fire place, the smell of fresh ale on old wood and the kind smile of the innkeeper ([Miryam Bell](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#myriam-bell)) behind the counter. One thing that is out of the ordinary though is the amount of hedgehog carvings littered throughout the tavern, somebody really likes hedgehogs here. The place is busy in the evenings and only some customers frequent during the day. Prices are reasonable but not cheap.
   
  </details>
  
  ## Westemar
  ### Retgard
  Captiol city of Westemar and home to the [Cathedral of Salvation]() and thus being a known location for pilgrims and believers all over the kingdom. Religion is part of almost every facet of live in Retgard and the pious out weigh the religously ambigious people by a landslide. As a consequence of church of Ilmather's influence, many forms of religiously infuced teachings have arised including monestaries, schools and even a lower academy. People not following the beliefs of Ilmather tend to turn away from Retgard or even Westemar as a whole or try to forge a path with other "non-religious renegardes". Retgard is governed my [Magistrate William Livingston]() who resides in the [Red Keep]().
  
  ## Forlon Forest
  ## Lake Morrighan
  ## Non-Altanarran
  ### Seydir Academy
  # Organizations and People of Interest

  ## The Collegium
  
  ## Cult of Szur
  Fanatics trying to somehow bring back the endtimes and restore the former lich-ascendant back to unlive. Led by their high apostle they aim to gather the shards of Szurs Phylactery for a dark ritual. The [High Inquisitors](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#forsworn) are aware of their plans but do not plan on intervening before they have gathered all or enough of these shards, as their creed to protected Altanarra from the undead scourge means to use every resource available, even if it means to use the dark magics still lingering in the shattered phylactery (They mean to consume the power of the souls still stored in the fragments to empower themselves further).
  The Cult occupied small hideouts all over Altanarra. 
  
  ## Forsworn
  The highest ranking paladings of the [Outriders](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#outriders), the High Inquisitors, form the [Forsworn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRhwM4iE-r0Vi07Oylui3JN2-pXIFHK9C-EO8phDwrrfCvQJ9UPjTpjb8xmkW-EdRAitU7L7q1efBYo/pub).
  They are the immortal guardians of the living in Altanarra, however it is unknown who these High Inquistors are and even their existence is a myth. In the rare cases that someone had seens a glimpse of an High Inquisitor they simply saw armorered holy warriors their faces hidden behind adorned helmets encircled by a sanguine halo

  ## Order of the Magi

  ### Selinesta
  
  ### Sofos Alitheia
  As the archmage of [Seydir Academy](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#seydir-academy), Sofos holds immense magical and political power. He is said to have founded the academy and rumors say that he is the undying patron of [Solaris](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#Solaris). 
  The rumors are somewhat true, as Sofos is a [Magus Dragon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSqiqtMLBS864bmnCuL5CZ4l0Z1QqohkHTgEYCGsmNQR7lf3Nr6ubovXepjor746vpeK6TW_OPdW7tf/pub)

  ## The Church of Ilmather

  One of the three pillars of might in Altanarra. The church of Ilmather builds the foundation of faith in the kingdom and preaches sacrifice and endurance as a virtue and necessity for the blessing of Ilmather. Enduring tragedy is but another test of their god and all in his will. The priests will help almost anyone in need, sacrificing their last possesions if must be as it is in the spirit of Ilmather. As this is why often the priests of Ilmather are seem with worn robes and bearly any possessions of their own. The **Cathedral of Salvation**, the most holy place in Altanarra and seat of [The Speaker](), is situated in Retgard to the Northwest. As a consequence, the townsfolk are very pious and the influence of the church can be felt throughout the whole town and its neighboring villages.

<details>
 <summary>Cathedral of Salvation</summary>

### The Speaker
 Chosen presumably by Ilmather himself to be his voice on the material plane. The Speaker has given up his former name and allegiances to fully embrace his divine calling of leading the church in the name and will of Ilmather and guiding all the lost souls of Altanarra and the whole of Omnia to salvation. Most people have only seen glimpses of him when he speaks with a booming voice filled with divine power to the people of Altanarra. His face and body hidden by an unpiercable veil his former identity remains a mystery.
The speaker is very well aware of the existence and origin of the [Forsworn](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#forsworn) and has deemed their sacrifice as worthy of Ilmathers mercy.

  ## Outriders

  The Outriders are a faction of paladins which overtime grew independent from the church of Ilmather and the kingdom as a whole. They stand to protect and eradicate the undeads scourging the lands at any cost necessary. The common folk are torn between admiration, respect and fear of the order, as they sometimes leave crops and even villages devastated after a purification crusade. Although the number of paladins is rather small, they managed to amass a sizable following of supporters, zealots and mercenaries to their cause. Hence not every member of the echelon is a paladin themselves, though the holy warriors decorate higher ranks crowned by the High Inquisitors. Mostly unknown figures, their faces hidden behind adorned helmets. Only their golden glowing eyes piercing the masks and a shining halo around their heads. Perfect and chosen they guide the Outriders to their goal of crushing the undead underfoot.
There are 5 High Inquisitors, with different Oaths and different fighting styles.

</details>

The Outriders will be neutral towards the adventurers and will not interfere (at the start) with their quest. This will only happen after a given time (Mercenaries etc. coming after them). If the Cult has amassed a critical amount of Shards, the Paladins will eradicate them (possibly together with the adventurers) and keep the fragments for themselves. Players will then need to find out the truth behind the Paladins (Forsworn Liches and the holy warrior [Idris Dawnbringer](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#idris-dawnbringer) is their commander). 
The court wizards (especially [Selinesta](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#selinesta)) will be of crucial importance to unveil their plans and help the adventurers further their goals. 

  
 ## Royal Family // House Germaine
  
 ### King Silas Germaine
 Silas Germaine, current King and 12th of his name, has ruled for over 10 years now. Inhertited the title from his father Theovold Germaine.
 A benevolent and just ruler, loved by his people, respected and feared his adversaries. The sometimes bloody dispute at the border to Daz'alor lies heavy on his mind, Slias does not thirst for blood but is in strong belief that the people of Caledence who ushered the desire to be part of Altanarra instead of Daz'alor, are in need of protetction and liberation, as every subject of the crown is deserving of. Silas is a giving and just king and if you please him he will be generous but as harsh if you fail him. He does believe in second chances but this is as far as it goes.
 ### Queen Charlotte Germaine
 Formerly Charlotte of house Cloverworth, was a noble woman from Retgard in Westemar. Chosen as a possible bride for the then prince Silas, she was trained to be a queen from an early age. Altough she may seem aloof from times, she is a softspoken and giving person at heart. Donating to orphanages and refuge homes throughout the whole kingdom and has visited Caledence on multiple times, inspiring the troops and the newly turned citizens of Caledence. She deeply cares for Silas and her children as much as she cares for Altanarra as a whole and tries to guide her husband with a soft-spoken air towards an even more fair rule. 
 ### Princess Leda Germaine
 First-born of the youngest line of house Germaine, Leda is as much of a warrior as one can be. As her ascendence to ruler is prohibited by her gender, she dedicated her life to the sword. Despite her still rather young age, she already rose to the rank of Captain. Currently stationed close the Borrsted she will be spending her time mostly in that region following her duties as captain.
 ### Prince Roderik Germaine
 Contrary to his sister Roderik is no fighter at all. A charming young man with a muse for the arts. He seems to have his head in the clouds sometimes and this worries his father as he is yet unfit to rule a kingdom. Silas sneaks out to play his lute with the art students at the academy, attend plays, visiting a tavern in disguise etc. Though not versed in magic per se he certainly has a affinity for it. 
   
## People of Grenzstad
### Frederic Thornberg
An older gentleman, sporting a sruff of grey hair on his chin and a slightly hunched back. He is welcoming towards newcomers but clearly is trying to put out the fires of disconcern in his small town with varying success. Frederic is desperate to be rid of the increasing mass of undead roaming the lands under his governance. Generally the people are fond of him but also are neutral towards him as a governor as he was the burgermaster for a long-time and somebody had to step up at that time as nobody wanted to do it. He is a former farmer and misses that time as he had to give it up for his governmental duties and he spends his few hours off duty on the farm of his son Ben Thornberg just beyond the town. He harbors disdain for the outriders and some degree towards the army as they all ignored his pleas as the matter is of too little importance (this is why he got the bounty for the dispatch of the source of the surge of undead)

### Myriam Bell
Matron of the **Sleepy Hedgehog Inn** and a stout woman. Her darkblonde hair is neatly braided around her head. She wears an apron over her working clothes. Hearty of character, motherly in tone and open for anyone who wishes to rest at her inn. She likes to gossip and keeps tabs on everybody she can prodding the drunks at her tavern, sometimes bribing them with another shot on the house. Myriam will the tell the charactes of the bounty that was issued by the burgermaster and send them on their way to him for further information.  
### Patrick Harper
Harper is the resident man of the cloth in Grenzstad. A smaller, thin man with thick darkbrown hair falling from his brow. Patrick wears a worn robe of Ilmather sporting the withe base color and the thick red trimmings. Around his neck hangs the symbol of Ilmather, two hands bound by a red string. If the players pay attention and succeed on a perception check they will notice scars on his hands and arms where his robes move, which is a known practise of the followers of Ilmather. He does not posses any holy powers but tends to the sick and wounded nontheless to the best of his abilites. He lives and worships in the small shrine towards the edge of town. He is a devout man following the teachings of the church of Ilamther to a T. He is willing to inform the players of the principles of the church if they are unaware, as he desires to spread to good word of Ilmather and will try to rope them into joining his prayer very soon into the conversation if they decided to question him about Ilmather. If the players decide to indulge he will offer them a healing potion as a reward for accepting the spirit of Ilmather. 

## Magistrates of Altanarra
### Gerrad Driscoll
A joyful man, might seem gullible at first due to his jolly character but has a sharp wit. He is in his fifties sporting a small belly, a limp, a balding head and a prominent greying moustache. Not the best fighter, never has been, not the best tactician but has very loyal people around him and is beloved by the populace for he is providing more public services as any other baron. A believer in Ilamther and so are many of his subjects. Driscoll has a daughter [Mathilda]() who is to be wed to a suitor soon but the arrangements have yet to be made. His wife Katarina died during childbirth which has made him protective of his daughter, the only living legacy left of his wife, and thus respects her wishes utmost.
Gerrad wishes to help the party and will appoint his advisor [Inyll]() to their disposal.
