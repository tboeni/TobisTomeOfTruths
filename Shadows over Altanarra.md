 <summary><h1>The Jaroomian Empire</h2></summary>
 
 The Jaroomian Empire lies far to the West, separated from the rest of Omnia by a natural mountain side, tall and fierce. Due to that fact, most contact with the center nations is limited to only the occasional traders by boat or caravan.
 The Empire is ruled by the Thunder King, a figure appearing in legends for many decades. Their beliefs are tribal and the land a lush and vibrant jungle.
 **Captiol:** Tokaar, City of Storms. Ruled by Jergal Oupha the "Thunder King"

 <summary><h1>Hyllestad</h2></summary>
 
 A cold and harsh land, ruled by clans and its unforgiving environment. Clan Rykke holds the title of strongest for several decades and is thus by right entitled to the rule of Hyllestad. Quarrels among the clans are no rarity, duels for honor and glory neither. 
 **Captiol:** Drunvold, Clan Rykke holds dominion over Drunvold and thus has the final word and sway over all the other clans. Chieftain Yvar Trollbane leads Clan Rykke

  **Captiol:** Hearth, the heart of the Altanarran Highlands. Ruled by [King Silas Germaine](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#king-silas-germaine)

  # Locations

  ## Hearth
  The bustling capitol of Altanarra. Much like the sigil of the country, the cities structure is reminicent of a great tree. Towering over the rest of Hearth is the "Crown" where the white tree, symbol of Altanarra, resides and the royal palace is situated. Some of the nobles are also allowed to reside in their mansions here. The Crown is separated by massive walls from the lower district the "Branches" where most of the trading and education is done. The main barracks are also found here as well as the tall church of Ilmather. The people living in the Branches are mostly wealthy trades people and other people of middle to higher social status. Again separated by thick walls in the lowest parts of Hearth one find the "Roots". Most of the poorer common folk is situated here. But most things can be found here as well, just of lesser quality most of the times. Thhe people are not wealthy but mostly content here. There is crime but not rampant.

  ### Grenzstad

  The largest most southern town of Sodemar. A rather poor place, made up by mostly trades people and farmers. A small shirne to Ilmather is located here, but no priest with divine powers resides in Grenzstad. There is a single inn where a bed for the night can be rented. The town is lead by Ealdorman [Frederic Thornberg]() who also issued the contract about the shadowy figures haunting the surroundings of Grenzstad at night.
  The inn is lead by [Miryam Bell](). (She is part of the Cult, sending the adventurers on a quest to the first shard. And tries to take it from them when they are weakended)
  The priest of the shrine is [Patrick Harper]()

  # Organizations and People of Interest
  
  ## Cult of Szur
  Fanatics trying to somehow bring back the endtimes and restore the former lich-ascendant back to unlive. Led by their high apostle they aim to gather the shards of Szurs Phylactery for a dark ritual. The [High Inquisitors](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#forsworn) are aware of their plans but do not plan on intervening before they have gathered all or enough of these shards, as their creed to protected Altanarra from the undead scourge means to use every resource available, even if it means to use the dark magics still lingering in the shattered phylactery (They mean to consume the power of the souls still stored in the fragments to empower themselves further).
  The Cult occupied small hideouts all over Altanarra. 
  
  ## Forsworn
  The highest ranking paladings of the [Outriders](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#outriders), the High Inquisitors, form the [Forsworn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRhwM4iE-r0Vi07Oylui3JN2-pXIFHK9C-EO8phDwrrfCvQJ9UPjTpjb8xmkW-EdRAitU7L7q1efBYo/pub).
  They are the immortal guardians of the living in Altanarra, however it is unknown who these High Inquistors are and even their existence is a myth. In the rare cases that someone had seens a glimpse of an High Inquisitor they simply saw armorered holy warriors their faces hidden behind adorned helmets encircled by a sanguine halo

  ## Order of the Magi

  ### Selinesta
  
  ### Sofos Alitheia
  As the archmage of [Seydir Academy](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#seydir-academy), Sofos holds immense magical and political power. He is said to have founded the academy and rumors say that he is the undying patron of [Solaris](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#Solaris). 
  The rumors are somewhat true, as Sofos is a [Magus Dragon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSqiqtMLBS864bmnCuL5CZ4l0Z1QqohkHTgEYCGsmNQR7lf3Nr6ubovXepjor746vpeK6TW_OPdW7tf/pub)

  ## Outriders

  The Outriders are a faction of paladins which overtime grew independent from the church of Ilmather and the kingdom as a whole. They stand to protect and eradicate the undeads scourging the lands at any cost necessary. The common folk are torn between admiration, respect and fear of the order, as they sometimes leave crops and even villages devastated after a purification crusade. Although the number of paladins is rather small, they managed to amass a sizable following of supporters, zealots and mercenaries to their cause. Hence not every member of the echelon is a paladin themselves, though the holy warriors decorate higher ranks crowned by the High Inquisitors. Mostly unknown figures, their faces hidden behind adorned helmets. Only their golden glowing eyes piercing the masks and a shining halo around their heads. Perfect and chosen they guide the Outriders to their goal of crushing the undead underfoot.
There are 5 High Inquisitors, with different Oaths and different fighting styles.

</details>

The Outriders will be neutral towards the adventurers and will not interfere (at the start) with their quest. This will only happen after a given time (Mercenaries etc. coming after them). If the Cult has amassed a critical amount of Shards, the Paladins will eradicate them (possibly together with the adventurers) and keep the fragments for themselves. Players will then need to find out the truth behind the Paladins (Forsworn Liches and the holy warrior [Idris Dawnbringer](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#idris-dawnbringer) is their commander). 
The court wizards (especially [Selinesta](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#selinesta)) will be of crucial importance to unveil their plans and help the adventurers further their goals.
