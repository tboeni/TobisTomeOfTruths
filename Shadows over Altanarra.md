<details>
 <summary><h1>The Jaroomian Empire</h2></summary>
 
 The Jaroomian Empire lies far to the West, separated from the rest of Omnia by a natural mountain side, tall and fierce. Due to that fact, most contact with the center nations is limited to only the occasional traders by boat or caravan.
 The Empire is ruled by the Thunder King, a figure appearing in legends for many decades. Their beliefs are tribal and the land a lush and vibrant jungle.
 **Captiol:** Tokaar, City of Storms. Ruled by Jergal Oupha the "Thunder King"

 <summary><h1>Hyllestad</h2></summary>
 
 A cold and harsh land, ruled by clans and its unforgiving environment. Clan Rykke holds the title of strongest for several decades and is thus by right entitled to the rule of Hyllestad. Quarrels among the clans are no rarity, duels for honor and glory neither. 
 **Captiol:** Drunvold, Clan Rykke holds dominion over Drunvold and thus has the final word and sway over all the other clans. Chieftain Yvar Trollbane leads Clan Rykke

  # Locations
  
 </details>

  ## Heartlands
  Melting pot of Altanarran culture especially in and around Hearth. The flat lands and mild temperatures during spring and summer build very optimal conditions for farming, as the Heartlands build one of the pillars of food production for the kingdom.
  ### Hearth
The bustling capitol of Altanarra. Much like the sigil of the country, the cities structure is reminicent of a great tree. Towering over the rest of Hearth is the "Crown" where the white tree, symbol of Altanarra, resides and the royal palace is situated. Some of the nobles are also allowed to reside in their mansions here. The Crown is separated by massive walls from the lower district the "Branches" where most of the trading and education is done. The main barracks are also found here as well as the tall church of Ilmather. The people living in the Branches are mostly wealthy trades people and other people of middle to higher social status. Again separated by thick walls in the lowest parts of Hearth one find the "Roots". Most of the poorer common folk is situated here. But most things can be found here as well, just of lesser quality most of the times. Thhe people are not wealthy but mostly content here. There is crime but not rampant.

The Province is neither poor nor wealthy as most of its trade is compromised of Stone harvested from quarries along the mountainside and wood. Most of the populace is involed in the production of one of these goods, farming or fishing (especially around Lake Morrighan). [Gerrad Driscoll]() is the magistrate ruling the province from his castle in **Duskhaven** advised by [Inyll]() a mage of Seydir Academy.

  ### Duskhaven
  Captiol of Sodemar, the largest town of the province, bustling streets with merchants and tradespeople, many goods, equipment and baubles can be found here for a price. Most people are working class. The town is encolsed by thick city walls protected by the towns very own guards who are patrolling the streets, keeping law and order. A barracks of the royal army can be found here commandeered by [Knight Commander Thelian Lagon]() which is off limits to outsiders except by direct invitation or royal decree.

  <summary>Duskaven Barracks</summary>

  The Duskhaven Barracks are located right at the Southern city walls. They are protected by soldiers at all time though the lack of their presence in Duskhaven and Westemar as a whole can be felt. The Barracks are not overflowing with new recruits and/or veterans but instead many beds and sometimes posts are vacant. [Knight Commander Thelian Lagon]() is in charge of this detachment. Inside the barrakcs an inner yard can be found where drills are held. To one side there is the sleeping quarters and to the other the weapons chambers, administrative office and dining hall.

  ### Grenzstad

  The most southern town of Sodemar. A rather poor place in perspective of the rest of Sodemar, made up by mostly trades people and farmers. A small shirne to Ilmather is located here, but no priest with divine powers resides in Grenzstad. There is a single inn where a bed for the night can be rented. The town is lead by Ealdorman [Frederic Thornberg](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#frederic-thornberg) who also issued the contract about the shadowy figures haunting the surroundings of Grenzstad at night.
  The **Sleepy Hedgehog Inn** is lead by [Miryam Bell](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#myriam-bell). There are some simple vendors found on a crude market place selling general goods, groceries and the occasional weapon.
  The priest of the shrine is [Patrick Harper](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#patrick-harper) 
  <details>
  <summary>Sleepy Hedgehog Inn</summary>

  The inn is nothing but a very ordinary inn. It is a two story building with the ground floor being the tavern area. Upon entering the inn, you greeted by a crackling fire place, the smell of fresh ale on old wood and the kind smile of the innkeeper ([Miryam Bell](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#myriam-bell)) behind the counter. One thing that is out of the ordinary though is the amount of hedgehog carvings littered throughout the tavern, somebody really likes hedgehogs here. The place is busy in the evenings and only some customers frequent during the day. Prices are reasonable but not cheap.

  <summary>Grenzstad Chapel</summary>
  Workplace and home of [Patrick Harper](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#patrick-harper). A tiny chapel, in good condition but old and it sees wear and tear on its inventory. There are no objects of value in the chapel and only idols of worship can be found on the small altar in the far back of the chapel. The building is located slightly on the outskirts of the village and despite its closeness is only rarely visited by a few devout followers of Ilmather or travellers.

  <summary>The Abandoned Graveyard </summary>

  A former apprentice of the magical arts has been risen into undeath as [Flameskull](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17091-flameskull) here and it creates undead from the corperses in the cementary and the fallen around the village of Grenzstad.
  The wizard apprentice is of house [**Valk**](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#house-valk).

 ### Oldorf

An abandoned village to the north of Grenzstad. It has been abandoned for a long time rather shortly after the resurgence of undead long years ago. The regional folk however never much intended to reclaim the village and thus the decaying building have ever since been used by outlaws, straggelers and other dodgy folk. But for a while now not even these people seem to dare set up camp in the abandoned village. Rumors are that a beast made its lair there, one horn, strong and wild.

<summary>"The Beast"</summary>

[Mouth of Grolantor](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/mouth-of-grolantor)

The creature carries a shard of the [Phylactery]() inside the edge of its forehead which was arguably mistaken by onlookers as a horn. Transformed by the dark magic of the phylactery, what once was a hill giant was violently transformed into this shambling mass. Saggy skin hanging from hits belly and arms, crazed by an unending hunger. "The Beast" made it's lair in the former [Valk](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#house-valk) Mansion which by now has been reduced to basically ruins. The roof caved in multiple parts, walls are torn down and the furniture shattered and weathered. The giant must have stumbeled upon the abandoned city before it's transformation ended and madness started to take hold.. Its tribe abandonded it for it seemed sick, vomit erupting from its mouth and skin starting to loosen more each day. Attracted by the former occupants the Mouth stayed in Oldorf after it lost its mind completely.

### Goldtooth Encampment
The mostly nomadic Goldtooth tribe has made a somewhat stationary camp near the bent of Jher River. Large tents resembling huts and a huge fire pit make the bulk of the camp. About a dozen hill giants call this their home. Modest trade can be done at the encampment, mostly interested in food, gold or other luxurious good they will offer either items they had previously traded from other travellers or merchants or offer safe passage through their lands often with the giant that has been traded with acting as a bodyguard for the travellers..

### Cave Laboratory
Not far to the East of the Goldtooth camp in the middle of giant land, the Szurists have established an experimentation site in a cave. Inside are a number of shelves and desks filled with mostly ruined reagents. In the middle of the chamber is a operation table conncted to a contraption holding one of the phylactery shards. The table is splattered with blood and other dried liquids. Corpses litter the floor, torn and pummeled, and among them lies a sliced monstrosity, a humanoid resembling abomination stitched togther from various people. At the corners of the room stand two inanimate suits of armor. These **Helmed Horrors** do only activate if someone tries to take the shard upon which they will engage immediately.
Among the ruined reagents and vials lies a stained note from an unknown ([Velcor, Szur's Mind](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#velcor-szurs-mind) urging the leading apothecary to be thorough as the success of these experiments is crucial for their success.

### Westbrook

A small village, not much larger than an hamlet. Townsfolk have been behaving strangely lately, a traveler, [Krembor Pondfisher](), was telling tales of blank food, joyless people and "dead" eyes in the [Gilden Mug]() in Duskhaven. After a visit just about a week or tenday ago of a travelling healer [Jerzy Tanov](), people have been acting unusual. He was offering them ointments, herbal remedies and elixirs for alleviating chronic pains and other worries. But this is not where Krembors story ends, he talks about how objects vanished from one moment to another and then suddenly appeared elsewhere in the room or in entirely another one, strange sounds from empty rooms and the feeling of constantly being watched. Krembor fled from Westbrook in a panic, leaving behind everything and everyone.
The Inn in Westbrook is still operational, and there are two patrons around. If the player characters decide to stay, they will experience the most bland food they had, conversations leading to nowhere and furniture moving when the do not look. The residents of the small village have been replaced by husks as a byproduct of a skulk investation, let loose by Apothecary Tanov. During his stay he brought one Skulk with him, which he used to murder the people he sedated by his tinctures. Those victinms in turn were turned into skulks as well (5 skulks in the end).
In the hidden and locked backroom of the basement of the tavern a gruesome sight can be found where the desecrated bodies of the victims lie on a pile. There are 11 bodies including Gwen (the girl Krembor wanted to propose). Opening the door will cause the activation of a messaging stone "I now know who you are, better watch your backs".

<details>
 <summary>Skulk</summary>

Skulk are made by necromantic magics that pull a lingering soul from a fresh corpse. It is twisted and tured via a lengthy process into a literal shadow of what the person once was, driven by maliciousness and servitude for its creator. Skulks assume the form of their last kill and pretend to be another in a very lifeless way. The Illusion can only be seen through by casting detect magic and succeeding a Arcana DC 15 check (with Dectect Magic Advantage).

## Westemar

### Retgard
  Captiol city of Westemar and home to the [Cathedral of Salvation]() and thus being a known location for pilgrims and believers all over the kingdom. Religion is part of almost every facet of live in Retgard and the pious out weigh the religously ambigious people by a landslide. As a consequence of church of Ilmather's influence, many forms of religiously infuced teachings have arised including monestaries, schools and even a lower academy. People not following the beliefs of Ilmather tend to turn away from Retgard or even Westemar as a whole or try to forge a path with other "non-religious renegardes". Retgard is governed my [Magistrate William Livingston]() who resides in the [Red Keep]().

  ### Gelshire Monastary
  Like many monasteries this is a place of worship, meditataion and education for aspiring people of the cloth. However, not only can one choose the path of a priest (or cleric if gifted with the touch of the divine) but also one of a aspiring paladin or a monk. Monks would act as a personal guard and also sometimes healers for the elite of the church. Gelshire Monastery is lead by  [Isolda Fairweather]() an older, devout woman but one would not see her as such as she moves with the grace of a young person teaching discipline, patience and virtue to the youngsters of the monastery.

  ## Cult of Szur / Szurists
  Fanatics trying to somehow bring back the endtimes and restore the former lich-ascendant back to unlive. Led by their high apostle they aim to gather the shards of Szurs Phylactery for a dark ritual. The [High Inquisitors](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#forsworn) are aware of their plans but do not plan on intervening before they have gathered all or enough of these shards, as their creed to protected Altanarra from the undead scourge means to use every resource available, even if it means to use the dark magics still lingering in the shattered phylactery (They mean to consume the power of the souls still stored in the fragments to empower themselves further).
  The Cult occupied small hideouts all over Altanarra. 

  The Szurists are divided into ranks:
* Aspirants (Grunts, the lowest rank. Used for manual labor and as expendable forces)
* Death Guards (Lieutenants, commanding rats in martial sitations and overseeing expedidtions and facilities)
* Apothecaries (on a similar ranking as Death Guards but not on the same chain of command, they conduct research and experiments in the name of Szur)
* Szur's Blade (Leader of everything martial)
* Szur's Mind (Defacto High Cultist and Leader)

### Velcor, Szur's Mind

Leader of the Szurists. His goal is to fulfill his dark masters once foiled plans and to create a kingdom (and later world) where the undead rule for eternity. To accomplish this and by proxy ascending to lichdom himself, he uses his followers to gather the lost splinters of Szurs Phylactery. The apothecaries at his command try to find ways of harnessing the latent powers in the shards to convert them into magic usable for dark creations to further bolster his forces with undead monstrosities and also a way of expediting the ritual needed to become a lich

Failed his experiment in the Laboratory inside the cavern hwere it went on a rampage. He also created SKulks in [Placeholder] Village as another experiment. He currently resides in an abandoned manor where he operated from, surrounded by his creations and lackies.
Moved to Westbrook to continue his research on life essence and how to manipulate souls into powerful thralls. Due to his experiments the villagers either ceased life or were twisted into Skulks.

  The rumors are somewhat true, as Sofos is a [Magus Dragon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSqiqtMLBS864bmnCuL5CZ4l0Z1QqohkHTgEYCGsmNQR7lf3Nr6ubovXepjor746vpeK6TW_OPdW7tf/pub)

  ## The Church of Ilmather

  One of the three pillars of might in Altanarra. The church of Ilmather builds the foundation of faith in the kingdom and preaches sacrifice and endurance as a virtue and necessity for the blessing of Ilmather. Enduring tragedy is but another test of their god and all in his will. The priests will help almost anyone in need, sacrificing their last possesions if must be as it is in the spirit of Ilmather. As this is why often the priests of Ilmather are seem with worn robes and bearly any possessions of their own. The **Cathedral of Salvation**, the most holy place in Altanarra and seat of [The Speaker](), is situated in Retgard to the Northwest. As a consequence, the townsfolk are very pious and the influence of the church can be felt throughout the whole town and its neighboring villages.

<details>
 <summary>Cathedral of Salvation</summary>
</details>

### The Speaker
 Chosen presumably by Ilmather himself to be his voice on the material plane. The Speaker has given up his former name and allegiances to fully embrace his divine calling of leading the church in the name and will of Ilmather and guiding all the lost souls of Altanarra and the whole of Omnia to salvation. Most people have only seen glimpses of him when he speaks with a booming voice filled with divine power to the people of Altanarra. His face and body hidden by an unpiercable veil his former identity remains a mystery.
The speaker is very well aware of the existence and origin of the [Forsworn](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#forsworn) and has deemed their sacrifice as worthy of Ilmathers mercy.

  ## Outriders

  The Outriders are a faction of paladins which overtime grew independent from the church of Ilmather and the kingdom as a whole. They stand to protect and eradicate the undeads scourging the lands at any cost necessary. The common folk are torn between admiration, respect and fear of the order, as they sometimes leave crops and even villages devastated after a purification crusade. Although the number of paladins is rather small, they managed to amass a sizable following of supporters, zealots and mercenaries to their cause. Hence not every member of the echelon is a paladin themselves, though the holy warriors decorate higher ranks crowned by the High Inquisitors. Mostly unknown figures, their faces hidden behind adorned helmets. Only their golden glowing eyes piercing the masks and a shining halo around their heads. Perfect and chosen they guide the Outriders to their goal of crushing the undead underfoot.
There are 5 High Inquisitors, with different Oaths and different fighting styles.

 ![Outriders](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a5286d7-4b81-48f1-b255-24f5ff3e40eb)

</details>

The Outriders will be neutral towards the adventurers and will not interfere (at the start) with their quest. This will only happen after a given time (Mercenaries etc. coming after them). If the Cult has amassed a critical amount of Shards, the Paladins will eradicate them (possibly together with the adventurers) and keep the fragments for themselves. Players will then need to find out the truth behind the Paladins (Forsworn Liches and the holy warrior [Idris Dawnbringer](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#idris-dawnbringer) is their commander). 
The court wizards (especially [Selinesta](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#selinesta)) will be of crucial importance to unveil their plans and help the adventurers further their goals.

### Mortar & Pestle



  
 ## Royal Family // House Germaine
  
 ### King Silas Germaine
 Silas Germaine, current King and 12th of his name, has ruled for over 10 years now. Inhertited the title from his father Theovold Germaine.
 A benevolent and just ruler, loved by his people, respected and feared his adversaries. The sometimes bloody dispute at the border to Daz'alor lies heavy on his mind, Slias does not thirst for blood but is in strong belief that the people of Caledence who ushered the desire to be part of Altanarra instead of Daz'alor, are in need of protetction and liberation, as every subject of the crown is deserving of. Silas is a giving and just king and if you please him he will be generous but as harsh if you fail him. He does believe in second chances but this is as far as it goes.

 ### Queen Charlotte Germaine
 Formerly Charlotte of house Cloverworth, was a noble woman from Retgard in Westemar. Chosen as a possible bride for the then prince Silas, she was trained to be a queen from an early age. Altough she may seem aloof from times, she is a softspoken and giving person at heart. Donating to orphanages and refuge homes throughout the whole kingdom and has visited Caledence on multiple times, inspiring the troops and the newly turned citizens of Caledence. She deeply cares for Silas and her children as much as she cares for Altanarra as a whole and tries to guide her husband with a soft-spoken air towards an even more fair rule. 
 ### Princess Leda Germaine
 First-born of the youngest line of house Germaine, Leda is as much of a warrior as one can be. As her ascendence to ruler is prohibited by her gender, she dedicated her life to the sword. Despite her still rather young age, she already rose to the rank of Captain. Currently stationed close the Borrsted she will be spending her time mostly in that region following her duties as captain.
 ### Prince Roderik Germaine
 Contrary to his sister Roderik is no fighter at all. A charming young man with a muse for the arts. He seems to have his head in the clouds sometimes and this worries his father as he is yet unfit to rule a kingdom. Silas sneaks out to play his lute with the art students at the academy, attend plays, visiting a tavern in disguise etc. Though not versed in magic per se he certainly has a affinity for it. 
   
## People of Grenzstad
### Frederic Thornberg
An older gentleman, sporting a sruff of grey hair on his chin and a slightly hunched back. He is welcoming towards newcomers but clearly is trying to put out the fires of disconcern in his small town with varying success. Frederic is desperate to be rid of the increasing mass of undead roaming the lands under his governance. Generally the people are fond of him but also are neutral towards him as a governor as he was the burgermaster for a long-time and somebody had to step up at that time as nobody wanted to do it. He is a former farmer and misses that time as he had to give it up for his governmental duties and he spends his few hours off duty on the farm of his son Ben Thornberg just beyond the town. Fredereic funnels a lot of his earnings from being the ealdorman into the farm of his sons family as he also lives there an gets to enjoy it through him and that is why he is keen on keeping his position, as losing it would change a lot for the family. He harbors disdain for the outriders and some degree towards the army as they all ignored his pleas as the matter is of too little importance (this is why he got the bounty for the dispatch of the source of the surge of undead)

### Myriam Bell
Matron of the **Sleepy Hedgehog Inn** and a stout woman. Her darkblonde hair is neatly braided around her head. She wears an apron over her working clothes. Hearty of character, motherly in tone and open for anyone who wishes to rest at her inn. She likes to gossip and keeps tabs on everybody she can prodding the drunks at her tavern, sometimes bribing them with another shot on the house. Myriam will the tell the charactes of the bounty that was issued by the burgermaster and send them on their way to him for further information.  
### Patrick Harper
Harper is the resident man of the cloth in Grenzstad. A smaller, thin man with thick darkbrown hair falling from his brow. Patrick wears a worn robe of Ilmather sporting the withe base color and the thick red trimmings. Around his neck hangs the symbol of Ilmather, two hands bound by a red string. If the players pay attention and succeed on a perception check they will notice scars on his hands and arms where his robes move, which is a known practise of the followers of Ilmather. He does not posses any holy powers but tends to the sick and wounded nontheless to the best of his abilites. He lives and worships in the small shrine towards the edge of town. He is a devout man following the teachings of the church of Ilamther to a T. He is willing to inform the players of the principles of the church if they are unaware, as he desires to spread to good word of Ilmather and will try to rope them into joining his prayer very soon into the conversation if they decided to question him about Ilmather. If the players decide to indulge he will offer them a healing potion as a reward for accepting the spirit of Ilmather. 


## People of Westbrook

### Krembor Pondfisher

A young, unkept lad. Shaggy dark hair, attire of a fisherman. Lived in Westbrook where he followed the trade of fishing after his parents passed early in his youth. He is timid by nature and scared by the recent events. Krembor had a sweet heart, Gwen, in the village that is why he could never leave before although ever since the passing of his partens he never felt at home in Westbrook anymore. Too timid to just approach her, he planned on proposing to her as a sign of his courage and seriousness. After resolving the issue in Westbrook he will offer the party his family heirloom ring (a silver ring with a inlaid garnet gemstone (25g). 

### Olaf Barner

Owner of the Pony Tavern. Replaced by a Skulk.

### Gwen Barner

Daugther of Olaf. Replaced by a Skulk.

## Magistrates of Altanarra
### Gerrad Driscoll
A joyful man, might seem gullible at first due to his jolly character but has a sharp wit. He is in his fifties sporting a small belly, a limp, a balding head and a prominent greying moustache. Not the best fighter, never has been, not the best tactician but has very loyal people around him and is beloved by the populace for he is providing more public services as any other magistrate. A believer in Ilamther and so are many of his subjects. Driscoll has a daughter [Mathilda](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#mathilda-driscoll) who is to be wed to a suitor soon but the arrangements have yet to be made. His wife **Katarina** (formerly of house [**Valk**](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#house-valk)) died during childbirth which has made him protective of his daughter, the only living legacy left of his wife, and thus respects her wishes utmost.
Gerrad wishes to help the party and will appoint his advisor [Inyll]() to their disposal.

### William Livingston
A rather calm fellow, close to the royal family. Strictly adhering the rules given by his Majesty. His people tolerate him but as he and his family have been put in place by the king and do not originate from Westermar, acceptance is still low. He himself is not as devout a man as many people of Westemar would have wished for and thus has to prove his loyalty to not only the crown and the people of Westemar but also to their faith of Ilmather. 

### Eghan Tierney

### Bronn MacGwean
A brash fellow, hot tempered, short of word and not the brightest. A strong fighter and upholds honor and does recognize it. His province encompassed the border conflict and the town of Riverwood at the center of the conflict. Though he is not the smartest when it comes to politics or science, Bronn excels at military strategies as they seem to come to him naturally. Almost like premunitons of what his opponent plans to do next. His residence, [Boulder Keep](), is more reminicent of a military fortress instead of a castle where a magistrate would reside. Garrisons decorate the walls of the keep. 

## Minor Houses of Altanarra

### House Valk
A now extinct family name. The last remnant of the house being **Mathilda Driscoll** daughter of [Magistrate Driscoll](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#gerrad-driscoll). The family was always burdened with early deaths of their offspring and tragic accidents, so that people would rumor them to be cursed for something that they had done in the past. Their family mausoleum lies within the abandoned graveyard. 

#### Mathilda Driscoll


#### Liam Valk
Former apprentice of Seydir Academy who met an unfortunate end during an expedition while in training. Buried in the family crypts and unfortunately turned into a Flameskull by the cult of Zur.

#### Jared Valk
A Outrider of the older days. He joined the paladins as an initate and not much was heard of him after that. Unbeknowst to the public he rose the ranks to become one of the [Forsworn](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#forsworn). Now long presumed dead as his natural life should have ended long ago and being a member of the Valk family known for their rahter short life spans.
#### House Wilenski

### House Helbron

#### Quentin Helbron
Defacto head of house Helbron since his older brother went missing in action after serving and receiving eductinon at [Gelshire Monastery](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#gelshire-monastary). Rumors say that he was somehow involved in his absence but that is not the case. Instead he has spent a significant portion of the houses income on finding out what happened to his brother.

### House Kiprovski

The brothers Kiprovski are the owners of the family business [Mortar & Pestle]()

## Advisors Altanarra
### Selinesta 

### Nelic 

### Eneth 

### Inyll Moonblade
Advisor to [Gerrad Driscoll](https://github.com/tboeni/TobisTomeOfTruths/blob/main/Shadows%20over%20Altanarra.md#gerrad-driscoll) in the province of Sodemar. She is a very calculated, observant person in contrast to the magistrate. She tends to feel a bit cold until one gets to know her on a more personal level. She is a tall and fair skinned elven lady. Pale skin and a regal air about her.

She is likely the first court wizard the players will encounter and present the first shard they found to her as the party will not have a clue to what the nature of this strange object is. In time she will deduct analysis on the splinter of Szurs Phylactery upon which the true nature of this object will be clear to her. She informs the party about it and tell them that this is of utmost secrecy as she has given this information to only the other court wizards and the king himself. As the party already knows (too) much, she urges them to act as special agents of the crown in order to find more of these shards and what the other party(ies) are trying to accomplish by harnessing their power. If the party accepts they will receive a magically inscribed emblem of the crown that grants them special treatment in many places and access to usually restricted places (it can be used a form of stamp) and she returns the first shard found by the party which now is placed inside a enchanted container and lets the user detect the precense of other shards in an area.

### Onorim 


## Residents of Castle Dusk

### Silvan, the keeper of books

## Goldtooth Clan
Clan Goldtooth is one of a few hill giant tribes along the Eastern side of the Dragon Ridge Mountains and is the wealthiest of them. However a rival tribe, the Thunderguts, are apparently trying to claim dominance of the hill giant clans with newly aquired wealth. Word is that they have made deals with a third party that made them richer and fatter than ever before. This happened in such short time that chief Bolg suspects that there is some trickery afoot and will look upon anyone as an steadfast ally that will side with him and bring clan Thundergut to justice by revealing their dirty secret.

### Orm
Got corrupted after receiving a shard of Szur's phylactery and got taken out by the party in Oldorf after ravaging the local bandit population.

### Chief Bolg
Leader of the clan and fattest and most wealthy of them. He thinks himself a business man and some sort of lord. He sports a tattered vest, a worn top hat and clunky golden rings on his enormous fingers and a gold chain on his neck. 
One of his massive canines is golden, hence the name of his clan and he likes to show it off at every opportunity that he gets. Bolg is good natured but hates trickery which may make him fly into an unreasonable rage but he might as well prove a powerful ally as well as and adversary.

## Clan Thundergut

### Chief Kol Thundergut
Kol has made a deal with the Szurists and in exchange for a magic ring (which grants him magical abilites and a hefty sum of gold). He gave the Szurists access to the resting place of former giant leaders (which is a cardinal sin among giant kind).
